# Image System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Size Limit (413 Content Too Large)
- **Problem**: Backend allowed 50MB but frontend showed 10MB limit, causing confusion
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased backend limit to 100MB in `routes/upload.js`
  - Updated frontend display to show 100MB limit
  - Fixed error messages to match actual limits

### 2. Image URL Generation
- **Problem**: Backend was returning relative paths like `/uploads/products/filename.jpg`
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified backend to return full URLs with backend domain
  - Added `BACKEND_URL` environment variable support
  - Created `getImageUrl()` utility function in frontend

### 3. CORS Issues (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOrigin)
- **Problem**: Images couldn't be accessed from frontend due to CORS restrictions
- **Solution**: 
  - Added specific route `/uploads/products/:filename` with proper CORS headers
  - Enhanced static file serving with additional CORS headers
  - Added `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` for better compatibility

### 4. Image Serving Problems
- **Problem**: Images returning 404 errors from both Vercel and Render
- **Solution**: 
  - Created dedicated image serving route with proper error handling
  - Added file existence checks
  - Implemented proper content-type headers based on file extensions
  - Added streaming for better performance

### 5. Frontend Configuration
- **Problem**: Next.js had insufficient body size limits and incorrect image domains
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased `bodySizeLimit` to 100MB
  - Updated image domains to include `counterfit-backend.onrender.com`
  - Fixed remote patterns for proper image loading

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `routes/upload.js` - File size limits and URL generation
- `server.js` - CORS headers and image serving route
- `config/env.example` - Added BACKEND_URL variable
- `env.production.example` - Added BACKEND_URL variable

### Frontend
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Added getImageUrl utility function
- `src/components/admin/ImageUpload.tsx` - Updated to use getImageUrl
- `next.config.js` - Increased body size limit and fixed image domains

## Environment Variables to Set

### Backend (.env file)
```bash
BACKEND_URL=https://counterfit-backend.onrender.com
```

### Frontend (.env.local file)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://counterfit-backend.onrender.com
```

## Testing

1. **Test Upload**: Try uploading a large image (>7MB) - should work now
2. **Test Image Display**: Check if existing images load properly
3. **Test CORS**: Images should load from frontend without CORS errors

## Debug Routes

- `/debug/uploads` - Check uploads directory contents
- `/test-image/:filename` - Test specific image existence
- `/uploads/products/:filename` - Direct image access with CORS

## Next Steps

1. Deploy backend changes to Render
2. Deploy frontend changes to Vercel
3. Test image upload and display functionality
4. Monitor for any remaining CORS or size limit issues

## Notes

- File size limit is now 100MB (configurable via environment variable)
- Images are served with full backend URLs
- CORS is properly configured for cross-origin image access
- Error handling includes detailed logging for debugging
